**Pizza Sales Analysis Project**
**Project Overview**
The Pizza Sales Analysis project is designed to explore and analyze pizza sales data using SQL for querying and Python (via Jupyter Notebook) for basic data analysis and visualization. The main focus of this project is to utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the sales database. Python is then used to support the analysis and visualize the results.

**Project Focus**
SQL Queries: The heart of the project lies in writing optimized SQL queries to extract relevant data from a sales database.
Data Analysis: Basic analysis of the data is performed to uncover insights like trends in sales, most popular pizza types, and sales patterns.
Data Visualization: After extracting the data with SQL, Python (in a Jupyter Notebook environment) is used to generate simple visualizations that help interpret the results.
Technologies Used
**SQL** For querying and manipulating the pizza sales database.
**Python** For performing basic data analysis and creating visualizations. Key libraries include:
**Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
**Matplotlib** for data visualization.
**Jupyter Notebook** An interactive environment used to write, execute, and document the code and analysis.
